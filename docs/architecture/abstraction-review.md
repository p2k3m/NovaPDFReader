# Abstraction review requirements

NovaPDF Reader depends on predictable rendering and storage behaviour to keep PDF sessions fast and crash-free. Any new caching, bitmap, PDF, or storage abstraction must go through an explicit review and ship with documentation that explains the trade-offs. Use this checklist whenever you introduce a new layer or significantly rework an existing one.

## When a review is required

Start an abstraction review when **any** of the following are true:

- You add a new caching strategy (in-memory, disk, hybrid, or network-backed).
- You introduce a bitmap or image-pool coordinator that is not a straight replacement of an existing implementation.
- You add a PDF processing pipeline, parser, renderer, or batching stage.
- You create a new storage surface (database, blob store, content provider, or filesystem wrapper) or replace the persistence backend for existing data.

File a design review issue and invite at least one maintainer from the engine or infrastructure team. Capture the discussion outcome and link it from the pull request description.

## Documentation expectations

Every abstraction review must produce a markdown document checked into `docs/architecture/` alongside the feature branch. The document should answer the following questions:

1. **Why this approach?** Summarize the alternatives considered and explain why the selected abstraction fits NovaPDF Reader's latency, memory, and reliability requirements.
2. **Failure modes.** Describe how the abstraction can fail in production (timeouts, corrupted blobs, bitmap pressure, cache eviction cascades, etc.) and what monitoring will surface those failures.
3. **Error surface.** Document the exact errors surfaced to callers, including the exception types, error codes, and whether they are retriable. Specify how errors propagate across coroutine boundaries or thread pools.
4. **Mitigations and fallbacks.** List retry strategies, invalidation hooks, telemetry, and cleanup routines that prevent failure amplification.
5. **Testing strategy.** Call out the unit, integration, and instrumentation coverage that validates happy paths and the failure scenarios above.

For a quick start, copy the template below into a new file named `<feature>-abstraction.md`:

```markdown
# <Feature name> abstraction review

## Summary
- **Author:** <Owner>
- **Reviewers:** <Maintainers involved>
- **Decision date:** <YYYY-MM-DD>

## Why this approach?
<Detail the constraints and the alternatives evaluated.>

## Failure modes
<Enumerate the ways the abstraction can fail and how those failures surface in logs or metrics.>

## Error surface
<Describe the errors callers receive and how upstream components should react.>

## Mitigations and fallbacks
<Document retries, fallbacks, and clean-up routines.>

## Testing strategy
<List the automated tests that exercise success and failure paths, plus any manual verification steps.>
```

Keep the document up to date as the implementation evolves. If an abstraction is retired or replaced, archive the review note by moving it to `docs/architecture/legacy/` with a short README explaining the deprecation.
