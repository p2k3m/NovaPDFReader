# Screenshot Harness Run – 2024-11-01

* Command: `tools/capture_screenshots_ci.sh`
* Result: ❌ Failed
* Summary: The script terminated immediately when attempting to collect the initial device resource snapshot because the Android Debug Bridge executable (`adb`) is not available in the current environment.
* Next steps: Install or expose `adb` in the PATH and ensure an Android emulator/device is reachable before re-running the harness.
