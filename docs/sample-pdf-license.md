# Sample PDF License

The bundled sample PDF decoded by the instrumentation tests is dedicated to the public domain under [Creative Commons CC0 1.0](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/). The Base64 representation checked into `app/src/androidTest/kotlin/com/novapdf/reader/SampleDocument.kt` was created specifically for automated workflows and may be redistributed without restriction.

The thousand-page stress fixture used by the screenshot harness (`app/src/androidTest/assets/thousand_page_fixture.base64`) is also an original work generated for this project. It carries the same CC0 1.0 dedication so that downstream automation can decode, cache, and redistribute the document without licensing constraints.
