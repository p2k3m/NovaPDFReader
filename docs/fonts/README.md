# Font Assets

The Roboto Flex variable font (`app/src/main/res/font/roboto_flex_variable.ttf`) was downloaded from the official Google Fonts repository:
https://github.com/google/fonts/raw/main/ofl/robotoflex/RobotoFlex%5BGX,opsz,wdth,wght%5D.ttf

The previous placeholder file contained an HTML download page, which caused runtime font loading failures during screenshot instrumentation tests.
